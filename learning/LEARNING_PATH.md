# ReddyGo Learning Path - Python to Deep Learning

**14-Week Comprehensive Programming Journey**

---

## Overview

This learning path transforms you from Python basics to building production-ready AI/ML systems, all while developing real features for the ReddyGo fitness platform.

## Structure

Each week follows this pattern:
- **Theory:** Concepts and fundamentals
- **Practice:** Coding exercises and problems
- **Project:** Build ReddyGo features
- **Review:** Document learnings

## Daily Schedule (2-3 hours)

```
Hour 1: Theory & Concepts
- Read theory materials
- Watch recommended videos
- Take notes

Hour 2: Hands-on Practice
- Solve practice problems
- Code exercises
- Debug and test

Hour 3: ReddyGo Project
- Apply concepts to real features
- Build production code
- Review and refactor
```

## Progress Tracking

Track your progress by completing:
- ✅ Theory checkpoints
- ✅ Practice exercises
- ✅ Project milestones
- ✅ Code reviews

## Phases

### Phase 1: Python Foundation (Week 1-2)
