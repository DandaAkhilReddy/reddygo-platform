        "Time series forecasting",
        "Speech recognition"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "ImageNet is a massive dataset with millions of labeled images across 1000 classes, used for pre-training vision models."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these is a popular pre-trained CNN architecture?",
      "options": [
        "LSTM",
        "ResNet",
        "BERT",
        "GPT"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "ResNet (Residual Network) is a popular CNN architecture with skip connections, pre-trained on ImageNet."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are residual connections (skip connections) in ResNet?",
      "options": [
        "Connections to residual data",
        "Shortcut connections that add input to output, helping train very deep networks",
        "Connections that remove noise",
        "Random connections"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skip connections add the layer input to its output, allowing gradients to flow better and enabling very deep networks (100+ layers)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is object detection?",
      "options": [
        "Classifying entire images",
        "Locating and classifying multiple objects in an image with bounding boxes",
        "Detecting image quality",
        "Finding image edges"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Object detection finds where objects are (bounding boxes) and what they are (classes) in an image."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is semantic segmentation?",
      "options": [
        "Dividing text into segments",
        "Classifying each pixel in an image to its category",
        "Segmenting audio",
        "Dividing data into train/test"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel, creating a mask showing where each object class is."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of non-maximum suppression (NMS)?",
      "options": [
        "Removing noise from images",
        "Removing duplicate/overlapping bounding boxes in object detection",
        "Reducing image size",
        "Suppressing gradients"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "NMS removes redundant overlapping bounding boxes, keeping only the box with highest confidence for each object."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between classification and localization?",
      "options": [
        "They are the same",
        "Classification labels the image, localization also finds where the object is",
        "Localization is faster",
        "Classification uses more data"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Classification answers 'what is it?', localization answers 'what is it and where is it?' (bounding box)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What image preprocessing is typically done before feeding to a CNN?",
      "options": [
        "Convert to grayscale only",
        "Resize to fixed size, normalize pixel values (e.g., to [0,1] or standardize)",
        "Compress the image",
        "Add noise"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Images are resized to network's expected input size and pixels are normalized for better training stability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is feature visualization in CNNs?",
      "options": [
        "Listing all features",
        "Visualizing what patterns/features each layer or filter detects",
        "Plotting training curves",
        "Showing the network architecture"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Feature visualization shows what visual patterns activate specific neurons, helping interpret what the network learned."

        "Removing dropout"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Transfer learning leverages knowledge from models trained on large datasets, and data augmentation increases effective dataset size."
