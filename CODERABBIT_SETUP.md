# CodeRabbit Setup Instructions

CodeRabbit is an AI-powered code review tool that automatically reviews your pull requests.

## âœ… What's Already Configured

- âœ… `.coderabbit.yaml` - Configuration file
- âœ… GitHub Secret `CODERABBIT_API_KEY` - API key stored securely
- âœ… Test PR Created: #1 (Friends System)

## ðŸš€ How to Enable CodeRabbit Reviews

CodeRabbit works as a **GitHub App**, not a GitHub Action. Follow these steps:

### Option 1: Install CodeRabbit GitHub App (Recommended)

1. **Visit CodeRabbit**
   - Go to https://coderabbit.ai
   - Click "Sign in with GitHub"

2. **Install the App**
   - Select your repository: `DandaAkhilReddy/reddygo-platform`
   - Grant permissions for:
     - Read access to code
     - Write access to pull requests and issues

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Open PR #1: https://github.com/DandaAkhilReddy/reddygo-platform/pull/1
   - CodeRabbit should automatically post a review within 1-2 minutes

### Option 2: Use API Key Directly (Advanced)

If you prefer API integration:

1. **API Key Already Set**: Your key `cr-c7b7c2da54cf5a77d3b50747dffc104fe51cf625df227cccbb5e272f96` is stored as a GitHub secret

2. **Manual API Calls**: Use curl or Python to trigger reviews:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.coderabbit.ai/v1/reviews \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODERABBIT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo": "DandaAkhilReddy/reddygo-platform",
    "pr_number": 1
  }'
```
